**Student Database Management System**

This Java program enables users to manage a student database efficiently. The program utilizes a class named `Student` with attributes such as name, roll number, age, and marks. It implements functionalities like adding students, viewing student details, searching students by roll number, calculating average marks, and handling exceptions gracefully.

### Features:

1. **Add Students:** Users can add new students to the database with unique roll numbers.

2. **View Students:** Display the details of all the students stored in the database.

3. **Search Student:** Implement a search functionality where users can search for a student by roll number and view their details.

4. **Calculate Average Marks:** Calculates and displays the average marks of all the students in the database.

5. **Exception Handling:** Handles exceptions such as negative marks or invalid roll numbers gracefully using custom exception classes.
